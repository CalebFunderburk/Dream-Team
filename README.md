# Dream Team

## About this App

### Description 

Dream Team is a command line application that accepts user input in order to generate a responsive HTML file for a team of workers.

### User Story

As a business manager looking for a way to make a webpage for my team, I would like an application that accepts my user input to generate a sleek HTML file. When I run the application, I am presented with a series of prompts that ask me for information regarding the team I am working with. Once the prompts have been answered, I can view my generated HTML file in the dist folder of my project.

### Features

1. This HTML file displays profiles with employee information that the manager enters themselves.
2. The information displayed varies for each type of employee you can create.
3. Users will also be able to click on different elements of the employees portflio in order to be taken to those external links (E.g.: if you click on the Engineer's GitHub username, a new tab will open taking you to their profile.)

## Installation

* Clone this repository to receive all the files.
